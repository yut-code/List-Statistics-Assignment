#Take a list of floats and returns the lowest one
#example: lowestnum = [1.5, 4.1, 8.0, 10.06, 3.004] -> 1.5
#if the list is empty returns 0.0


#Takes a list of integers and returns the product of all its even integers and the product of all the odd integers 
#example: evenProduct = [-1, 4, -6, 10, 3] -> -240
#example: oddProduct = [-1, 4, -6, 10, 3] -> -3
